  <p>
    <strong>Small Business Plans</strong> are group health insurance offerings
    designed specifically for employers with a limited number of
    employees—typically from 1 up to 50 or 100, depending on state rules. These
    plans pool risk across a small workforce, allowing business owners to
    provide competitive benefits, share premium costs with employees, and access
    federal tax credits (for those with fewer than 25 full‑time equivalent
    workers).
  </p>
</div>

<div className="mb-12">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Small Business Plans Work</h2>
  <p>
    Small Business Plans are purchased through a health insurance carrier or the
    Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) marketplace. The employer
    selects a plan design—such as HMO, PPO, or EPO—and contributes a percentage
    of each employee’s premium. Enrolled employees and any dependents then pay
    the remainder via payroll deductions. Participation requirements and
    contribution levels are set by the employer within regulatory guidelines.

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Implementation Process:</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Eligibility Assessment:</strong> Confirm number of full‑time
        equivalent employees and shop marketplace eligibility in your state.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Carrier Selection:</strong> Compare plan networks, premium
        rates, and benefits among available insurers or SHOP offerings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan Design:</strong> Choose coverage levels (e.g., bronze,
        silver, gold) and cost‑sharing structures (deductibles, copays,
        coinsurance).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Employee Enrollment:</strong> Conduct annual open enrollment or
        special enrollment events; employees select individual tiers and add
        dependents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Premium Contributions:</strong> Employer pays a fixed percentage
        (often 50%–75%) of each enrolled employee’s premium; employees pay the
        remainder.
      </li>

  </p>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Group Purchasing Power:</h3>
    <p>
      By aggregating a small workforce, employers gain access to group‐rated

  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Tax Credits & Incentives:</h3>
    <p>
      Eligible small businesses (fewer than 25 FTEs, average wage under $54,200)
      can receive up to a 50% (25% for tax‑exempt) tax credit on SHOP premiums.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Flexible Cost Sharing:</h3>
    <p>

  <div className="mb-4">
