    Supplemental Insurance

<div className="mb-8">
  <p>
    <strong>Supplemental Insurance</strong> refers to additional insurance
    policies designed to complement your primary health coverage. These plans
    help fill in the gaps that standard health insurance may leave, such as
    covering out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles, copayments, and other costs
    not fully paid by your main policy. Supplemental insurance can provide
    financial support during unexpected medical events, helping to ease the
    burden of high medical costs and ensuring a more comprehensive level of
    care.

<div className="mb-12">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Supplemental Insurance Works</h2>
  <p>
    Supplemental insurance is purchased in addition to your primary health plan.
    It is specifically designed to cover expenses that your main policy may not,
    such as gaps in coverage for certain services, hospital stays, or critical
    illnesses. When you incur a qualifying medical expense, the supplemental
    policy pays a predetermined benefit amount directly to you, helping to
    offset costs like deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. This arrangement
    provides an added layer of financial protection, ensuring that unexpected
    expenses do not lead to significant out-of-pocket burdens.

      The Supplemental Insurance Process:
    </h3>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Application and Underwriting:</strong> Just like primary
        insurance, supplemental plans require an application process where your
        health status and risk factors are evaluated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Benefit Determination:</strong> The policy outlines specific
        benefits and payout amounts for various medical events or conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Claim Submission:</strong> When you experience a covered event,
        you submit a claim and, upon approval, receive a benefit payment to help
        cover your additional expenses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Direct Payment:</strong> Benefits are typically paid directly to
        the policyholder, offering flexibility in how the funds are used—be it
        for medical bills, everyday living expenses, or other needs during
        recovery.
      </li>
    </ul>

  </div>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Cost Considerations:</h3>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Underwriting Requirements:</h3>
