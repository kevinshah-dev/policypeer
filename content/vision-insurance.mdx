  <p>
    <strong>Vision Insurance</strong> is a specialized health benefit designed
    to offset the costs of routine eye care, corrective lenses, and related
    services. Unlike general medical insurance, vision plans focus on preventive
    exams, prescription eyewear, and discounts on corrective procedures—helping
    individuals maintain healthy eyesight and detect vision issues early.

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Vision Insurance Works</h2>
  <p>
    Vision insurance typically operates on an annual benefit cycle. You pay a
    monthly or annual premium in exchange for set allowances and copays for
    covered services. When you visit an in‑network provider, the plan covers
    routine exams at low or no cost, and applies allowances toward frames,
    lenses, or contact lenses. Any expenses beyond the allowance or network
    benefit are paid out of pocket.
