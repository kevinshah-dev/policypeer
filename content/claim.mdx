    A <strong>claim</strong> is a formal request made by a policyholder to their
    insurance company for compensation or coverage after a loss or damage
    occurs. Whether it’s the aftermath of an auto accident, damage to your home
    from a storm, or unexpected medical expenses, filing a claim is how you ask
    your insurer to help cover the costs as outlined in your policy.
    Essentially, a claim is the process that activates your coverage when you
    need it most.

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Claims Work</h2>
  <p>
    The claims process is designed to assess your situation and determine
    whether your loss is covered by your policy. When an incident occurs, you
    notify your insurer, who then assigns an adjuster to investigate the details
    of your claim. This investigation includes verifying the facts, reviewing
    documentation, and sometimes inspecting the damage firsthand. Based on this
    evaluation, the insurer decides to approve, partially approve, or deny your
    claim. If approved, you receive a payment or service to help repair or
    replace the damaged property or cover incurred expenses.

    multiple claims or claims involving high amounts of money can signal higher
    risk to insurers, potentially leading to increased premiums. It’s important
    to weigh the benefits of filing a claim against the possibility of higher
    future costs.
