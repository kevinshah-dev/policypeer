    NADAC (National Average Drug Acquisition Cost)
  </h1>
</div>

<div className="mb-8">
  <p>
    <strong>NADAC</strong> stands for National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, a
    benchmark price published monthly by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
    Services (CMS). It represents the average invoice price that retail
    pharmacies pay to acquire prescription drugs, based on real-world purchase
    data submitted under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. NADAC is widely used
    by state Medicaid programs, benefit managers, and pharmacies to promote
    transparent, data‑driven reimbursement and reduce excessive markups.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="mb-12">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How NADAC Is Calculated</h2>
  <p>
    CMS collects invoice data from thousands of participating pharmacies
    nationwide to determine the true cost of acquiring medications. Each month,
    submitted invoices are aggregated and cleaned of outliers, and an average
    price per unit (tablet, milliliter, etc.) is computed. The resulting NADAC
    value excludes dispensing fees, administrative costs, and manufacturer
    rebates, focusing solely on acquisition cost.
  </p>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Calculation Process:</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Data Collection:</strong> Pharmacies submit drug invoice prices
        under CMS’s voluntary reporting program.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> CMS removes extreme values and anomalies
        to ensure consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Averaging:</strong> The cleaned data is averaged by National
        Drug Code (NDC) and unit strength.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Publication:</strong> NADAC rates are released monthly on the
        CMS website and through APIs.

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Key Features of NADAC</h2>
  <p>
    NADAC offers several characteristics that make it a reliable pricing
    benchmark:
  </p>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Transparency:</h3>
    <p>
      Based on actual invoice data, NADAC reveals the true acquisition cost of
      drugs as paid by pharmacies.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Timeliness:</h3>
    <p>
      Monthly updates ensure NADAC reflects current market conditions and price
      fluctuations.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Standardization:</h3>
    <p>
      Calculated per unit of measure for each NDC, providing consistency across
      pharmacies and states.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div className="mb-12">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Benefits of NADAC</h2>
  <p>
    Adopting NADAC-based reimbursement and contracting can yield multiple
    advantages:
  </p>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Cost Control:</h3>
    <p>
      States and payers can cap reimbursement at NADAC plus a modest dispensing
      fee to limit overpayment.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Market Efficiency:</h3>
    <p>
      By exposing true acquisition costs, NADAC helps drive competition and
      discourages excessive markups.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Data‑Driven Policy:</h3>
    <p>
      Policymakers use NADAC analytics to monitor pricing trends and support
      formulary decisions.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div className="mb-12">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Limitations and Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    While NADAC provides critical insight, there are some caveats to bear in
    mind:
  </p>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Excludes Dispensing Fees:</h3>
    <p>
      NADAC reflects only acquisition cost and does not account for pharmacies’
      overhead or labor.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Voluntary Reporting:</h3>
    <p>
      Participation by pharmacies is voluntary, which may lead to gaps in data
      coverage for certain drugs.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Rebate Impact:</h3>
    <p>
      Manufacturer rebates negotiated post‑purchase are not reflected, so NADAC
      may overstate net costs.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div className="mb-12">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Who Uses NADAC</h2>
  <p>
    A variety of stakeholders rely on NADAC to inform pricing and reimbursement
    strategies:
  </p>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">State Medicaid Agencies:</h3>
    <p>
      Use NADAC to set maximum reimbursement rates and manage budget impact.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs):</h3>
    <p>
      Incorporate NADAC into contracts to benchmark real costs and negotiate
      rebates.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Retail Pharmacies:</h3>
    <p>
      Compare their actual acquisition costs against NADAC to ensure competitive
      pricing.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div className="mb-12">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Impact on Drug Pricing and Policy</h2>
  <p>
    NADAC has reshaped drug reimbursement by shining light on the true costs
    pharmacies face. It has led to tighter pharmacy margins, encouraged price
    negotiations, and influenced national debates on drug pricing reform. Many
    states have successfully reduced Medicaid pharmacy expenditures by tying
    reimbursements to NADAC benchmarks.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="mb-12">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Summary</h2>
  <p>
    In summary, <strong>NADAC</strong> is a pivotal tool for transparent drug
    pricing, offering a standardized, up‑to‑date measure of pharmacies’
    acquisition costs. While it doesn’t cover every element of pharmacy
    reimbursement, NADAC’s data‑driven approach empowers payers, policymakers,
    and pharmacies to make informed decisions and helps drive greater efficiency
    and fairness in the pharmacy supply chain.
