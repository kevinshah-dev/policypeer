    <strong>Dental Insurance</strong> is a type of health coverage specifically
    designed to help manage the costs of dental care. It typically covers a
    range of services from routine preventive care—such as cleanings, exams, and
    x-rays—to basic procedures like fillings and extractions, and in some plans,
    even major dental work such as crowns, bridges, and orthodontics.

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Dental Insurance Works</h2>
  <p>
    Dental insurance functions by helping you pay for a portion of your dental
    care costs in exchange for a regular premium payment. When you visit a
    dentist, the plan may cover preventive services at little to no cost, while
    more complex procedures often require you to pay a deductible and a
    percentage of the cost (coinsurance). Most dental insurance plans operate on
    a network basis, meaning you receive the best benefits when you use
    providers within the insurer’s network.

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Limitations and Challenges</h2>
  <p>
    Despite its benefits, dental insurance also comes with certain limitations
    that are important to consider:
  </p>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Coverage Limits:</h3>
    <p>
      Most plans have an annual maximum payout, which may not cover extensive
      dental work if multiple procedures are needed in a year.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Waiting Periods:</h3>
    <p>
      Some procedures, particularly major dental work, may have waiting periods
      before coverage kicks in, delaying access to benefits.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Provider Network Restrictions:</h3>
    <p>
      To receive the full benefits, you must usually use dentists within the
